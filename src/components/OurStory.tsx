              <p>
                At EduTrack, we believe every student has untapped potential, but we noticed a growing problem in classrooms: slow learners were often overlooked until it was too late. Many students, especially in large classes, silently struggled, losing confidence and falling behind without anyone realizing.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                We saw this firsthand in schools across India and asked ourselves: What if we could catch these struggles earlier? What if teachers could identify slow learners in real-time and provide personalized help before the learning gap widened?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Driven by this vision, we created EduTracker, an AI-powered tool designed to pinpoint students who need extra support, helping teachers take immediate action. EduTracker doesn't just identify the problemâ€”it also suggests tailored learning paths to ensure every student has the chance to succeed.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                We built this to empower schools and change lives, one student at a time.
